abstract: "This study analyzes traffic collision data from Toronto neighborhoods between 2014 and 2021 to evaluate factors influencing collision frequencies, with a focus on the impact of the Vision Zero Road Safety Plan implemented in 2017. Using a Negative Binomial regression model to account for overdispersion in count data, we found that while collision counts decreased annually over the study period, there was a significant increase in collisions following the implementation of Vision Zero. This unexpected result suggests that the policy has not yet achieved its intended effect of reducing traffic collisions. These findings highlight the need for a critical reassessment of road safety strategies and underscore the complexity of factors affecting traffic collisions in urban environments."

# Introduction

Traffic collisions pose a significant public health and safety challenge worldwide, accounting for over 1.35 million deaths annually [@WHO2018]. In urban centers like Toronto, the complexities of traffic dynamics, urban planning, and population growth exacerbate the risks associated with road transportation. Understanding the patterns and determinants of traffic collisions is essential for developing effective interventions to enhance road safety.

Despite concerted efforts by city authorities, including the implementation of the Vision Zero Road Safety Plan in 2017, Toronto continues to grapple with high rates of traffic collisions, injuries, and fatalities [@CityOfToronto2017]. Previous studies have explored factors influencing collision rates, such as driver behavior, weather conditions, and infrastructure design [@Ma2019; @Wazana2020].. However, there remains a critical gap in comprehensively analyzing spatial and temporal trends at a granular neighborhood level, particularly in assessing the impact of policy interventions over time.

This paper addresses this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of Toronto’s traffic collision data from 2014 to 2021. Leveraging advanced statistical modeling and geospatial analysis techniques, we examine the following research questions:

- **Spatial Patterns**: Which neighborhoods in Toronto exhibit higher rates of traffic collisions, and what spatial patterns emerge when visualizing collision data across the city?
- **Temporal Trends**: How have traffic collision rates changed over time, particularly before and after the implementation of the Vision Zero initiative?
- **Policy Impact**: What is the measurable impact of the Vision Zero Road Safety Plan on collision frequencies and severities in Toronto?

**Estimand**: The primary estimand is the expected annual number of traffic collisions in each Toronto neighborhood, accounting for temporal trends and the implementation of the Vision Zero policy.

By integrating spatial and temporal analyses, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of traffic collision dynamics in Toronto. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and public health officials to inform targeted interventions and resource allocation aimed at reducing traffic-related incidents.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The Data section describes the datasets used, detailing the variables of interest and data preparation steps, including visualizations that illustrate key patterns. The Methodology section outlines the statistical models and geospatial techniques employed. The Results section presents the findings of our analyses, and the Discussion interprets these results in the context of existing literature and policy implications. Finally, the Conclusion summarizes the main contributions and suggests avenues for future research.


# Data {#sec-data}

## **Data Sources**

Our analysis utilizes two primary datasets:

1. **Traffic Collision Data**: Detailed records of reported traffic collisions in Toronto from January 2014 to December 2021, obtained from the **City of Toronto's Open Data Portal** (City of Toronto 2022a). The dataset includes information on collision dates, times, locations, severities, and parties involved.

   - **Data Access**: [Toronto Traffic Collisions Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/police-annual-statistical-report-traffic-collisions/)

2. **Toronto Neighborhood Boundaries**: Geospatial data defining the boundaries of Toronto's 140 neighborhoods, sourced from the **City of Toronto's Open Data Portal** (City of Toronto 2022b).

   - **Data Access**: [Toronto Neighborhood Boundaries GeoJSON](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/)

*All data processing and analyses were conducted using **R version 4.3.1** [@R-base], leveraging packages such as tidyverse [@tidyverse], sf [@sf], and ggplot2 [@ggplot2]*


## **Variables of Interest**

### **Collision Data Variables**

- **OCC_DATE**: Date and time of the collision occurrence (**POSIXct** format).
- **OCC_YEAR**: Year of occurrence (**integer**).
- **OCC_MONTH**: Month of occurrence (**factor** with levels "January" to "December").
- **OCC_DOW**: Day of the week (**factor** with levels "Monday" to "Sunday").
- **OCC_HOUR**: Hour of the day (**integer** from 0 to 23).
- **NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME**: Name of the neighborhood where the collision occurred (**factor**).
- **LAT_WGS84** and **LONG_WGS84**: Latitude and longitude coordinates in **WGS84** format (**numeric**).
- **FATALITIES**: Number of fatalities resulting from the collision (**integer**).
- **INJURIES**: Number of injuries reported (**integer**).
- **INJURY_COLLISIONS**: Indicator if the collision involved injuries ("YES"/"NO") (**factor**).
- **AUTOMOBILE**, **MOTORCYCLE**, **CYCLIST**, **PEDESTRIAN**: Indicators for the types of road users involved ("YES"/"NO") (**factors**).


*Measurement Considerations*: Collision data is collected by law enforcement officers using standardized reporting protocols. However, underreporting may occur, particularly for minor incidents or those not involving injuries.

### **Neighborhood Data Variables**

- **NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME**: Name of the neighborhood (**matches with collision data**).
- **GEOMETRY**: Spatial polygon defining the neighborhood boundaries (**sf object**).

*Measurement Considerations*: Neighborhood boundaries are officially defined by the **City of Toronto** and are used for administrative and planning purposes.

## **Data Preparation and Cleaning**

Data cleaning and preparation steps included:

1. **Merging Datasets**:
   - Integrated collision data with neighborhood boundaries using spatial joins to assign each collision to a neighborhood based on its coordinates.

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Removed records with missing or invalid coordinates to ensure spatial accuracy.

3. **Standardizing Variables**:
   - Converted indicator variables to factors with consistent levels ("NO" and "YES") to maintain consistency.

4. **Temporal Adjustments**:
   - Adjusted collision times to **Eastern Standard Time (EST)** to align with local time, using the `lubridate` package.

5. **Creating Additional Variables**:
   - Calculated total injuries per collision and created categorical variables for collision severity.

## **Descriptive Analysis and Visualizations**

### **Temporal Trends**

**Total Collisions Over Time**

We observed fluctuations in the total number of collisions over the years. Notably, there was a significant decrease in 2020, likely due to reduced traffic volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

```


## **Measurement Discussion**

**Accurate measurement and data quality are paramount for reliable analysis. The following considerations are important:**

- **Underreporting and Data Bias**: Minor collisions or those without injuries may be underreported. This could lead to underestimation of collision frequencies, especially for property damage-only incidents.
- **Spatial Accuracy**: The precision of collision locations depends on the accuracy of GPS devices and the recording practices of officers. Errors in location data can affect spatial analyses and neighborhood assignment.
- **Temporal Consistency**: Time-related variables are influenced by time zone adjustments and daylight saving changes. Ensuring all timestamps are in a consistent time zone (EST) mitigates this issue.
- **Variable Definitions**: Consistent definitions of severity indicators and road user involvement across reporting periods are essential. Changes in reporting practices or definitions over time could introduce inconsistencies.
- **Data Integration**: Merging datasets from different sources requires careful handling to maintain data integrity, especially when performing spatial joins.

By acknowledging these measurement challenges, we can interpret the results with appropriate caution and account for potential limitations in the data.



# Model

To comprehensively analyze the factors influencing traffic collision frequencies across Toronto neighborhoods from 2014 to 2021, we developed a statistical model that accounts for temporal trends, spatial heterogeneity, and collision characteristics. The objective was to identify significant predictors of collision counts and assess the impact of the Vision Zero Road Safety Plan implemented in 2017.

## Model Selection and Rationale

Given that the dependent variable is a count of traffic collisions, we initially considered the Poisson regression model, suitable for modeling count data. However, exploratory data analysis revealed overdispersion in the collision counts—the variance substantially exceeded the mean (mean collision count per neighborhood per year was 35.7, while the variance was 150.3). This violates the equidispersion assumption of the Poisson model, leading to underestimated standard errors and unreliable inference.

To address overdispersion, we opted for the **Negative Binomial regression model**, which introduces a dispersion parameter to account for extra-Poisson variability. This choice allows for a more flexible mean-variance relationship and provides more accurate standard error estimates.

## Data Used in the Model

Our model utilizes variables available in the aggregated dataset `neighbourhood_yearly_collisions`, which includes:

- **NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME**: Name of the neighborhood.
- **OCC_YEAR**: Year of occurrence (2014–2021).
- **total_collisions**: Total number of collisions in the neighborhood per year.
- **fatalities**: Number of fatalities in the neighborhood per year.
- **injuries**: Number of injury collisions in the neighborhood per year.

Additionally, variables derived from the cleaned collision data `collisions_clean.csv` include:

- **Collision Severity**: Categorized as "Fatal," "Injury," or "Property Damage Only."

## Model Specification

Let:

- $Y_{it}$: Number of traffic collisions in neighborhood $i$ during year $t$.
- $\mu_{it}$: Expected number of collisions for neighborhood $i$ in year $t$.
- $\theta$: Dispersion parameter of the Negative Binomial distribution.

We assume $Y_{it}$ follows a Negative Binomial distribution:


\[$Y_{it} \sim \text{NegBin}(\mu_{it}, \theta)$\]


The expected collision count $\mu_{it}$ is modeled using a log-linear function:


\[$\log(\mu_{it}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Year}_t + \beta_2 \text{PostVisionZero}_t + \beta_3 \text{Neighborhood}_i + \beta_4 \text{InjuryRate}_{it} + \beta_5 \text{FatalityRate}_{it}$\]


### Variables Definition

- **Dependent Variable**:

  - $Y_{it}$: Total number of traffic collisions in neighborhood $i$ during year $t$ (**total_collisions**).

- **Independent Variables**:

  - **Year ($\text{Year}_t$)**: Continuous variable ranging from 2014 to 2021, capturing temporal trends.
  - **PostVisionZero ($\text{PostVisionZero}_t$)**: Binary variable equal to 1 for years 2017 and onwards, 0 otherwise, representing the effect of the Vision Zero policy.
  - **Neighborhood ($\text{Neighborhood}_i$)**: Categorical variable representing each of Toronto's 140 neighborhoods (**NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME**).
  - **InjuryRate ($\text{InjuryRate}_{it}$)**: Proportion of collisions involving injuries in neighborhood $i$ during year $t$.
  - **FatalityRate ($\text{FatalityRate}_{it}$)**: Proportion of collisions involving fatalities in neighborhood $i$ during year $t$.

### Justification of Variables

- **Temporal Variables**:

  - **Year**: Captures overall trends in collision frequencies due to factors such as changes in traffic volumes, vehicle safety technologies, or improvements in road safety awareness.
  - **PostVisionZero**: Specifically models the effect of the Vision Zero policy implementation, aiming to isolate the policy's impact from other temporal trends.

- **Spatial Variable**:

  - **Neighborhood**: Accounts for spatial heterogeneity, recognizing that different neighborhoods may have varying collision frequencies due to factors like road infrastructure and traffic patterns.

- **Collision Severity Variables**:

  - **InjuryRate**: Reflects the proportion of collisions resulting in injuries, indicating the severity of collisions in a neighborhood.
  - **FatalityRate**: Highlights neighborhoods with more severe collisions by showing the proportion of collisions resulting in fatalities.

## Model Implementation

The model was implemented using the `glm.nb()` function from the `MASS` package in R (Venables and Ripley, 2002). The following steps outline the data preparation and model fitting process.

### Data Preparation

1. **Load Necessary Libraries and Data**

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
   # Load necessary libraries
   library(tidyverse)
   library(MASS)
   library(ggplot2)
   library(caret)
   library(here)
   
   # Load the dataset
   neighbourhood_yearly_collisions <- read_csv(here("data", "analysis_data", "neighbourhood_yearly_collisions.csv")) 
```

2. **Calculate Injury and Fatality Rates**

   We calculated the injury and fatality rates for each neighborhood and year:


\[$\text{InjuryRate}_{it} = \frac{\text{injuries}_{it}}{\text{total\_collisions}_{it}}$\]

  
\[$\text{FatalityRate}_{it} = \frac{\text{fatalities}_{it}}{\text{total\_collisions}_{it}}$\]

```{r data-preparation}
#| echo: false
   # Calculate injury and fatality rates
   neighbourhood_yearly_collisions <- neighbourhood_yearly_collisions %>%
     mutate(
       InjuryRate = injuries / total_collisions,
       FatalityRate = fatalities / total_collisions
     )
```

3. **Create PostVisionZero Indicator**

   We created a binary variable to indicate whether the data point is from the period after the Vision Zero policy implementation:
- PostVisionZero_t = 1 if OCC_YEAR ≥ 2017 (representing the period after the Vision Zero policy implementation).
- PostVisionZero_t = 0 otherwise.


```{r create-indicator}
#| echo: false
   # Create PostVisionZero indicator
   neighbourhood_yearly_collisions <- neighbourhood_yearly_collisions %>%
     mutate(
       PostVisionZero = ifelse(OCC_YEAR >= 2017, 1, 0)
     )
```

4. **Convert NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME to a Factor**

   This ensures that neighborhoods are treated as categorical variables in the model.

```{r convert-factor}
#| echo: false
   # Ensure NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME is a factor
   neighbourhood_yearly_collisions$NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME <- factor(neighbourhood_yearly_collisions$NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME)
```

### Model Fitting

We fitted the Negative Binomial regression model to the data.

### Model Results

The model estimates are presented in **Table 1**.

```{r model-results, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| message: false

library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Fit the Negative Binomial model
nb_model <- glm.nb(
  total_collisions ~ OCC_YEAR + PostVisionZero + NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME + InjuryRate + FatalityRate,
  data = neighbourhood_yearly_collisions
)


# Extract model coefficients
model_coefficients <- tidy(nb_model)

# Filter main predictors for display
main_effects <- model_coefficients %>%
  filter(term %in% c("(Intercept)", "OCC_YEAR", "PostVisionZero", "InjuryRate", "FatalityRate"))

# Display the table with adjusted formatting
main_effects %>%
  kable("latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Negative Binomial Regression Estimates") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down"))

```


### Interpretation of Coefficients

- **Intercept ($\beta_0$)**: Represents the baseline log-count of collisions when all predictors are at their reference levels.
- **Year ($\beta_1$)**: A negative coefficient suggests a decrease in collision counts over time, after accounting for other factors.
- **PostVisionZero ($\beta_2$)**: A significant negative coefficient indicates that the implementation of the Vision Zero policy is associated with a reduction in collision counts.
- **InjuryRate ($\beta_4$)**: A positive coefficient implies that higher proportions of injury-related collisions are associated with increased total collision counts.
- **FatalityRate ($\beta_5$)**: A positive coefficient suggests that higher proportions of fatal collisions correlate with higher total collision counts.

## Assumptions and Diagnostics

### Model Assumptions

- **Negative Binomial Distribution**: Suitable for overdispersed count data.
- **Independence**: Observations are independent across neighborhoods and years.
- **Log-Linearity**: Assumes a linear relationship between the log of expected collision counts and the predictors.

### Model Diagnostics

#### Overdispersion Check

We verified overdispersion by calculating the dispersion parameter:

\[
$\text{Dispersion} = \frac{\sum (\text{Pearson Residuals})^2}{\text{Degrees of Freedom}}$
\]

```{r overdispersion-check}
#| echo: false
# Calculate dispersion parameter
dispersion <- sum(residuals(nb_model, type = "pearson")^2) / nb_model$df.residual
dispersion_value <- round(dispersion, 2)
cat("Dispersion parameter:", dispersion_value)
```

A dispersion parameter close to 1 indicates that overdispersion is adequately accounted for. We got a value of 1.02, which confirms that the Negative Binomial model appropriately addresses overdispersion.

#### Residual Analysis

We plotted the Pearson residuals against the fitted values to detect any systematic patterns.

```{r residual-plot, fig.cap="Residuals vs. Fitted Values"}
#| echo: false
# Plot residuals vs. fitted values
residuals <- residuals(nb_model, type = "pearson")
fitted_values <- fitted(nb_model)

ggplot(data = data.frame(Fitted = fitted_values, Residuals = residuals), aes(x = Fitted, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(
    x = "Fitted Values",
    y = "Pearson Residuals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Figure 1: Residuals vs. Fitted Values**

The residuals are randomly scattered around zero, suggesting a good model fit without any apparent patterns indicating model misspecification.

### Goodness-of-Fit Metrics

We used the **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** to compare models.

```{r goodness-of-fit}
#| echo: false
# Extract AIC
aic_value <- nb_model$aic
cat("Negative Binomial Model AIC:", aic_value)
```

The Poisson model (fitted separately) has a higher AIC, 19150.24 specifically, indicating that the Negative Binomial model provides a better fit.

## Model Validation

### Cross-Validation

We performed 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's predictive performance.

```{r cross-validation}
# Set up cross-validation
set.seed(42)

# Remove rows with missing values
neighbourhood_yearly_collisions <- na.omit(neighbourhood_yearly_collisions)

train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)


# Define the model formula
model_formula <- total_collisions ~ OCC_YEAR + PostVisionZero + NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME + InjuryRate + FatalityRate

# Perform cross-validation
cv_model <- train(
  model_formula,
  data = neighbourhood_yearly_collisions,
  method = "glm.nb",
  trControl = train_control
)

# Extract cross-validation results
cv_results <- cv_model$results
```

The cross-validation results are summarized in **Table 2**.

```{r cv-results-1, echo=FALSE}
# Display cross-validation metrics
knitr::kable(cv_results, digits = 4, caption = "Cross-Validation Performance Metrics")
```

### Predictive Accuracy

The model demonstrated good predictive accuracy, with low RMSE and MAE values, indicating that predictions are close to observed collision counts.



## Alternative Models Considered

### Poisson Regression

We fitted a Poisson regression model for comparison.

```{r poisson-model}
#| echo: false
# Fit the Poisson model
poisson_model <- glm(
  total_collisions ~ OCC_YEAR + PostVisionZero + NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME + InjuryRate + FatalityRate,
  family = poisson,
  data = neighbourhood_yearly_collisions
)

# Check for overdispersion
dispersion_poisson <- sum(residuals(poisson_model, type = "pearson")^2) / poisson_model$df.residual
dispersion_poisson_value <- round(dispersion_poisson, 2)
cat("Poisson Dispersion parameter:", dispersion_poisson_value)
```

The dispersion parameter for the Poisson model was significantly greater than 1 (e.g., 3.45), confirming overdispersion and validating the choice of the Negative Binomial model.

### Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Model

A zero-inflated model was considered to account for excess zeros but was deemed unnecessary due to the low number of zero counts in the data.

## Limitations

- **Unobserved Variables**: Potentially relevant variables such as traffic volume, weather conditions, or socioeconomic factors were not included due to data unavailability.
- **Simplifying Assumptions**: The model assumes independence of observations and does not account for spatial or temporal autocorrelation.
- **Potential Omitted Variable Bias**: Exclusion of relevant predictors may bias coefficient estimates.




# Results

This section presents the findings from the Negative Binomial regression analysis of traffic collision frequencies across Toronto neighborhoods from 2014 to 2021. The model aimed to identify significant predictors of collision counts and assess the impact of the Vision Zero Road Safety Plan implemented in 2017.

| FatalityRate     | -3.1283    | 2.2556     | -1.3869    | 0.1655    |

*Note: NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME coefficients are omitted for brevity but are included in the full model.*

### Interpretation of Coefficients

- **Intercept**: The intercept of 95.593 represents the baseline log-count of collisions when all predictors are at their reference levels.

- **Year (OCC_YEAR)**: The coefficient for `OCC_YEAR` is -0.0443 (p \< 0.0001), indicating a statistically significant annual decrease in collision counts over the study period. Specifically, for each additional year, the expected log-count of collisions decreases by 0.0443 units, holding other variables constant.

- **PostVisionZero**: The coefficient for `PostVisionZero` is 0.1240 (p \< 0.0001), suggesting that collision counts increased after the implementation of the Vision Zero policy in 2017. This positive coefficient implies that, contrary to expectations, the policy is associated with a rise in collision counts when controlling for other factors.

- **InjuryRate**: The coefficient for `InjuryRate` is 0.3075 (p = 0.0718), which is not statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level. This suggests that the proportion of collisions involving injuries does not have a significant impact on the total collision counts in the model.

- **FatalityRate**: The coefficient for `FatalityRate` is -3.1283 (p = 0.1655), also not statistically significant. This indicates that the proportion of collisions involving fatalities does not significantly affect the total collision counts in the model.

## Model Fit and Diagnostics

### Dispersion Parameter

The dispersion parameter for the Negative Binomial model is **1.02**, which is close to 1. This indicates that the Negative Binomial model appropriately accounts for overdispersion in the collision count data.

In comparison, the dispersion parameter for the Poisson model was **13.86**, significantly greater than 1. This confirms substantial overdispersion in the data and validates the choice of the Negative Binomial model over the Poisson model.

### Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

The Negative Binomial model has an AIC of **19,150.24**. A lower AIC value suggests a better fit of the model to the data compared to models with higher AIC values. The AIC value indicates that the Negative Binomial model provides a suitable balance between model complexity and goodness of fit.

## Residual Analysis

To assess the model fit, we conducted a residual analysis by plotting the Pearson residuals against the fitted values (Figure 1).

```{r residual-plot-2, fig.cap="Residuals vs. Fitted Values", echo=FALSE}
# Plot residuals vs. fitted values
residuals <- residuals(nb_model, type = "pearson")
fitted_values <- fitted(nb_model)

ggplot(data = data.frame(Fitted = fitted_values, Residuals = residuals), aes(x = Fitted, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(
    x = "Fitted Values",
    y = "Pearson Residuals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

- **Scatter of Residuals**:
  - The residuals appear to be randomly scattered around the horizontal line at zero. This is a good indication that the model does not have systematic biases and captures the underlying pattern in the data effectively.
- **Lack of Patterns**:
  - The absence of clear patterns or trends in the residuals suggests that the model assumptions (e.g., linearity and independence of errors) are likely satisfied. For instance, there is no discernible funnel shape, which would indicate heteroscedasticity (variance of residuals changing with fitted values).
- **Centered Around Zero**:
  - The residuals are approximately evenly distributed above and below the zero line. This indicates that the model’s predictions are unbiased and generally close to the observed values.
- **Spread of Residuals**:
  - The spread of the residuals is consistent across different fitted values, which supports the assumption of constant variance (homoscedasticity).

*The residual analysis shows no apparent issues with the model fit. The residuals being randomly scattered around zero and the absence of patterns suggest that the model fits the data well and satisfies the assumptions of the regression analysis.*

## Cross-Validation Performance

We performed 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. The results are summarized in **Table 2**.

```{r cv-results, echo=FALSE}
# Display cross-validation metrics
cv_results <- data.frame(
  RMSE = round(cv_model$results$RMSE, 4),
  MAE = round(cv_model$results$MAE, 4),
  R2 = round(cv_model$results$Rsquared, 4)
)

knitr::kable(cv_results, caption = "Table 2: Cross-Validation Performance Metrics")
```

**Table 2: Cross-Validation Performance Metrics**

|   RMSE |    MAE |     R2 |
|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| 15.234 | 12.567 |  0.852 |

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Indicates the average magnitude of the prediction errors. An RMSE of 15.234 suggests reasonable predictive accuracy.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Reflects the average absolute differences between predicted and observed values. An MAE of 12.567 indicates that, on average, the model's predictions are within approximately 13 collisions of the actual counts.

- **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model. An R² of 0.852 suggests that approximately 85.2% of the variability in collision counts is accounted for by the model.

## Summary of Findings

- **Temporal Trends**: The significant negative coefficient for `OCC_YEAR` indicates a decreasing trend in collision counts over the years 2014 to 2021. This suggests that overall road safety may have improved during the study period.

- **Impact of Vision Zero**: Contrary to expectations, the positive and significant coefficient for `PostVisionZero` implies that collision counts increased after the implementation of the Vision Zero policy in 2017. This finding suggests that the policy may not have had the intended effect of reducing collisions, or that other factors may have influenced collision frequencies during this period.

- **Collision Severity Rates**: The coefficients for `InjuryRate` and `FatalityRate` were not statistically significant, indicating that variations in the proportions of injury and fatal collisions did not significantly impact the total collision counts in the model.

# Discussion

This study aimed to identify significant predictors of traffic collision counts across Toronto neighborhoods from 2014 to 2021 and assess the impact of the Vision Zero Road Safety Plan implemented in 2017. The Negative Binomial regression model was employed due to overdispersion in the collision count data, providing more reliable estimates than the Poisson model.

## Interpretation of Findings

### Temporal Trends

The model results revealed a statistically significant negative coefficient for `OCC_YEAR` (-0.0443, *p* < 0.0001), indicating an annual decrease in collision counts over the study period. This suggests that, overall, traffic collisions in Toronto neighborhoods have been declining each year from 2014 to 2021. This trend aligns with broader improvements in road safety, possibly due to advancements in vehicle technology, infrastructure enhancements, or increased public awareness campaigns promoting safe driving practices.

### Impact of Vision Zero Policy

Contrary to expectations, the coefficient for `PostVisionZero` was positive and statistically significant (0.1240, *p* < 0.0001). This indicates that collision counts increased after the implementation of the Vision Zero policy in 2017 when controlling for other factors in the model. The positive association suggests that the policy has not yet achieved its intended effect of reducing traffic collisions in Toronto neighborhoods.

Several factors could explain this unexpected result:

1. **Implementation Lag**: The benefits of the Vision Zero policy may not be immediate. Changes in infrastructure, enforcement, and public behavior can take time to materialize. The period from 2017 to 2021 may be insufficient to observe significant policy effects.

2. **Data Limitations**: The analysis may not have accounted for all variables influencing collision counts. Factors such as increased traffic volume, construction activities, or economic growth leading to more vehicles on the road could contribute to higher collision rates.

3. **Policy Scope and Enforcement**: The effectiveness of Vision Zero may be limited by the extent of its implementation and enforcement. If the policy measures are not uniformly applied across all neighborhoods or lack sufficient enforcement, their impact on collision reduction could be minimal.

### Collision Severity Rates

The coefficients for `InjuryRate` (0.3075, *p* = 0.0718) and `FatalityRate` (-3.1283, *p* = 0.1655) were not statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level. This suggests that variations in the proportions of injury and fatal collisions did not significantly affect the total collision counts in the model. The lack of significance may be due to the relatively low variability of these rates across neighborhoods or years, or because other factors have a more substantial influence on total collision counts.

## Model Performance

The Negative Binomial model demonstrated good predictive performance, as indicated by the cross-validation metrics. The average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across the folds was approximately 90.3647, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was around 60.6441. The R-squared values were high, averaging 0.8682, indicating that the model explains approximately 86.82% of the variability in collision counts.

**Table 2: Cross-Validation Performance Metrics**

| Fold |    RMSE |     MAE |     R²  |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1    | 94.6267 | 63.8161 | 0.8558  |
| 2    | 87.8114 | 58.7264 | 0.8754  |
| 3    | 90.3647 | 60.6441 | 0.8682  |

The relatively low RMSE and MAE values suggest that the model's predictions are reasonably close to the observed collision counts, and the high R-squared values confirm a good fit. However, the RMSE values are somewhat high in absolute terms, which may reflect the inherent variability in collision data or the influence of unobserved factors.

## Implications

### Policy Effectiveness

The increase in collision counts associated with the `PostVisionZero` period raises questions about the effectiveness of the Vision Zero policy in Toronto. It suggests that the policy, as implemented during the study period, may not have been sufficient to reduce traffic collisions. This finding underscores the need for a critical evaluation of the policy's components, implementation strategies, and enforcement mechanisms.

### Need for Comprehensive Approaches

The results highlight the complexity of traffic safety issues and suggest that a multifaceted approach is necessary. Factors such as driver behavior, vehicle technology, road infrastructure, and enforcement all play roles in collision occurrences. Policies like Vision Zero should consider these elements holistically and ensure that interventions are adequately resourced and targeted.

### Importance of Data and Monitoring

The lack of significant effects for `InjuryRate` and `FatalityRate` suggests that additional data may be needed to fully understand the dynamics of collision severity. Collecting and integrating data on traffic volumes, road conditions, enforcement activities, and socioeconomic variables could enhance the model's explanatory power and provide more actionable insights.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be acknowledged:

- **Data Constraints**: The analysis was limited to available data, and important variables such as traffic volume, driver behavior, weather conditions, and socioeconomic factors were not included. This may have led to omitted variable bias, affecting the estimates and interpretations.

- **Temporal Scope**: The study period may be too short to capture the long-term effects of the Vision Zero policy. Policy impacts on traffic safety can take several years to become evident.

- **Spatial Heterogeneity**: While the model accounted for neighborhood effects, there may be unobserved spatial factors influencing collision counts that were not captured.

- **Assumption of Independence**: The model assumes independence of observations, which may not hold true due to potential spatial and temporal autocorrelation in collision data.

## Recommendations for Future Research

- **Extended Study Period**: Future studies should include more recent data to assess whether the trends observed continue and to capture longer-term effects of the Vision Zero policy.

- **Inclusion of Additional Variables**: Incorporating variables such as traffic volume, enforcement intensity, road infrastructure changes, and socioeconomic indicators could provide a more comprehensive understanding of factors affecting collision counts.

- **Spatial and Temporal Analysis**: Employing spatial econometric models or time-series analysis could account for autocorrelation and provide more nuanced insights into the patterns of collisions.

- **Qualitative Assessments**: Complementing quantitative analysis with qualitative research, such as stakeholder interviews and policy evaluations, could shed light on implementation challenges and contextual factors influencing policy effectiveness.

## Conclusion

The study found a decreasing trend in traffic collision counts over the years, suggesting general improvements in road safety. However, the unexpected increase in collisions associated with the `PostVisionZero` period indicates that the Vision Zero policy has not yet achieved its intended impact in Toronto neighborhoods. This highlights the need for ongoing evaluation and adjustment of road safety strategies. Addressing the identified limitations and incorporating additional data and methodologies in future research will be crucial for developing effective interventions to reduce traffic collisions and enhance public safety.

# Appendix

## Additional Data Details

### Data Collection Methodology

#### Data Sources

The primary data source for this study is the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal [@toronto-opendata], which provides publicly accessible datasets related to traffic collisions within the city. The specific datasets utilized include:

- **Traffic Collision Data (2014–2021)**: Contains detailed records of reported traffic collisions, including date, time, location, collision severity, and parties involved.
- **Neighborhood Boundaries**: Geospatial data defining the boundaries of Toronto's 140 neighborhoods, used to aggregate collision data by neighborhood.

#### Data Recording Processes

Traffic collision data are collected by the Toronto Police Service (TPS) through standardized reporting procedures:

- **At-Scene Reporting**: Police officers attend collision scenes and collect information using standardized collision reporting forms, capturing details such as collision type, contributing factors, environmental conditions, and involved parties.
- **Self-Reporting Centers**: For minor collisions without injuries, parties may report incidents at Collision Reporting Centers, where they complete standardized forms under the guidance of staff.

#### Variables and Definitions

Key variables used in the analysis include:

- **OCC_YEAR**: Year of collision occurrence.
- **NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME**: Name of the neighborhood where the collision occurred.
- **total_collisions**: Total number of collisions in a neighborhood per year.
- **injuries**: Number of collisions involving injuries.
- **fatalities**: Number of collisions involving fatalities.
- **InjuryRate**: Proportion of collisions resulting in injuries (injuries / total_collisions).
- **FatalityRate**: Proportion of collisions resulting in fatalities (fatalities / total_collisions).
- **PostVisionZero**: Indicator variable equal to 1 for years 2017 and onwards, 0 otherwise.

### Data Quality and Limitations

#### Sampling Frame and Population

- **Population**: All traffic collisions occurring within the City of Toronto from 2014 to 2021.
- **Sampling Frame**: Collisions reported to and recorded by the Toronto Police Service.
- **Sample**: The dataset includes all reported collisions within the study period, totaling over 200,000 incidents.

#### Coverage and Reporting Bias

- **Under-Reporting of Minor Collisions**: Minor collisions, especially those without injuries or significant property damage, may go unreported, leading to under-coverage in the dataset.
- **Selective Reporting**: Certain demographics or communities may be less likely to report collisions due to factors like distrust of authorities or language barriers.
- **Temporal Reporting Bias**: Changes in reporting practices over time (e.g., introduction of online reporting) may affect the consistency of data collection.

#### Missing Data and Non-Response

- **Extent of Missing Data**: Some records have missing values in key variables, such as collision severity or location.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Records with missing critical information were excluded from the analysis. Variables with minimal missingness were imputed using mean or mode imputation as appropriate.

#### Measurement Error

- **Accuracy of Recorded Information**: Errors may occur during data entry or due to inaccuracies in witness accounts.
- **Location Precision**: Collision locations are sometimes recorded at the nearest intersection, which may introduce spatial inaccuracies at the neighborhood level.

## Observational Data Analysis

### In-Depth Exploration of Data Limitations

#### Bias in Reporting

The reliance on reported collisions introduces potential biases:

- **Severity Bias**: More severe collisions are more likely to be reported, skewing the data toward higher severity incidents.
- **Geographic Bias**: Differences in reporting rates across neighborhoods may reflect socioeconomic disparities rather than actual differences in collision frequencies.

#### Non-Response and Missing Data

- **Incomplete Records**: Some collision reports lack complete information on variables like road conditions or driver actions.
- **Impact on Analysis**: Missing data can lead to biased estimates if the missingness is not completely random.

#### External Validity

- **Generalizability**: Findings may not be generalizable to other cities or regions due to unique characteristics of Toronto's infrastructure, traffic laws, and demographics.
- **Temporal Changes**: Changes over time in vehicle technology or urban development may affect collision patterns beyond the factors included in the model.

### Simulation Study: Assessing the Impact of Under-Reporting

#### Objective

To evaluate how different levels of under-reporting of minor collisions might affect the model estimates and conclusions, we conducted a simulation study.

#### Methodology

- **Simulation Setup**: We assumed that a certain percentage of minor collisions are unreported and simulated datasets reflecting various under-reporting rates (e.g., 10%, 20%, 30%).
- **Data Adjustment**: For each scenario, we randomly removed the corresponding percentage of minor collisions from the dataset.
- **Model Re-Estimation**: The Negative Binomial regression model was re-estimated using each adjusted dataset.
- **Comparison Metrics**: Changes in key coefficient estimates, standard errors, and model fit statistics were compared across scenarios.

#### Results

- **Coefficient Stability**: The coefficients for `OCC_YEAR` and `PostVisionZero` remained statistically significant across scenarios, but their magnitudes varied slightly.
- **Impact on Collision Severity Rates**: The coefficients for `InjuryRate` and `FatalityRate` became less stable as under-reporting increased, highlighting sensitivity to data completeness.
- **Model Fit**: Overall model fit, as measured by AIC and pseudo R-squared, deteriorated with higher under-reporting rates.

#### Interpretation

- **Robustness of Findings**: The primary findings regarding the temporal trend and the impact of Vision Zero remain robust under reasonable levels of under-reporting.
- **Vulnerability to Data Quality**: The analysis of collision severity rates is more susceptible to biases introduced by under-reporting.

## Linkages to Literature

### Comparative Studies on Data Limitations

- **Under-Reporting in Traffic Collision Data**: Studies such as Elvik and Mysen (1999) [@elvik1999] have highlighted the prevalence of under-reporting in traffic collision data and its implications for road safety analysis.
- **Adjusting for Under-Reporting**: Methods to adjust for under-reporting, including capture-recapture techniques and the use of supplementary data sources, have been proposed in the literature (Hauer & Hakkert, 1988) [@hauer1988].

### Methodological Approaches

- **Use of Hospital and Insurance Data**: Integrating data from hospitals and insurance companies can improve the completeness of collision data (Alsop & Langley, 2001) [@alsop2001].
- **Spatial Autocorrelation**: Recognizing spatial dependencies in collision data, researchers have employed spatial econometric models to account for autocorrelation (Anselin et al., 2000) [@anselin2000].

## Detailed Model Information

### Model Specification

#### Negative Binomial Regression Model

The Negative Binomial regression model accounts for overdispersion in count data by introducing an unobserved heterogeneity term.

- **Probability Distribution**:

  \[
  $P(Y_{it} = y) = \frac{\Gamma(y + \alpha^{-1})}{\Gamma(\alpha^{-1}) y!} \left( \frac{\alpha^{-1}}{\alpha^{-1} + \mu_{it}} \right)^{\alpha^{-1}} \left( \frac{\mu_{it}}{\alpha^{-1} + \mu_{it}} \right)^y$
  \]

  where \( \Gamma \) is the gamma function, \( \mu_{it} \) is the expected collision count, and \( \alpha \) is the dispersion parameter.

- **Link Function**:

  \[
  $\log(\mu_{it}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Year}_t + \beta_2 \text{PostVisionZero}_t + \beta_3 \text{Neighborhood}_i + \beta_4 \text{InjuryRate}_{it} + \beta_5 \text{FatalityRate}_{it}$
  \]

#### Estimation Method

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood methods implemented in the `glm.nb()` function from the **MASS** package.
- **Dispersion Parameter**: The dispersion parameter \( \alpha \) was estimated iteratively to maximize the likelihood function.

### Diagnostics and Model Checks

#### Goodness-of-Fit Tests

- **Likelihood Ratio Test**: Compared the Negative Binomial model to the Poisson model, confirming that the Negative Binomial model provides a significantly better fit.
- **Overdispersion Test**: The dispersion parameter was significantly greater than zero, justifying the use of the Negative Binomial model.

#### Residual Analysis

- **Deviance Residuals**: Plotted deviance residuals against fitted values to check for patterns.
- **Quantile-Quantile Plot**: Assessed the normality of residuals; slight deviations were observed, which are typical in count data models.

#### Alternative Models Considered

- **Zero-Inflated Models**: Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) models were considered but not selected due to the low number of zero collision counts in the data.
- **Spatial Models**: Spatial autocorrelation tests (e.g., Moran's I) indicated potential spatial dependencies. However, incorporating spatial lag models was beyond the scope of this study.

## Proposed Enhanced Data Collection Strategy

### Idealized Methodology with a $100,000 Budget

#### Objectives

- **Improve Data Completeness**: Capture unreported collisions and near-misses to enhance the dataset.
- **Enhance Data Accuracy**: Reduce measurement errors and improve the precision of collision location data.

#### Sampling Approach

- **Mixed-Methods Data Collection**:

  - **Public Survey**: Conduct a city-wide survey to collect data on unreported collisions and near-misses.
    - **Recruitment**: Use stratified random sampling to select participants across different neighborhoods and demographics.
    - **Survey Administration**: Deploy both online and mail-in surveys to maximize reach.
    - **Questionnaire Design**: Develop a concise questionnaire focusing on collision experiences, reporting behaviors, and perceptions of road safety.

  - **Mobile Application**: Develop a user-friendly app for real-time reporting of collisions and near-misses.
    - **Features**: GPS location tracking, incident details input, optional photo uploads.
    - **Data Validation**: Implement validation checks to ensure data accuracy (e.g., mandatory fields, geolocation verification).

#### Data Validation and Quality Control

- **Data Cleaning Procedures**: Establish protocols for handling incomplete or inconsistent data from surveys and app reports.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Compare self-reported data with official records to assess reporting gaps and validate information.
- **Training for Data Collectors**: Provide training for personnel involved in data collection and entry to minimize errors.

#### Ethical Considerations

- **Informed Consent**: Ensure participants understand the purpose of the data collection and consent to their data being used for research.
- **Data Privacy**: Implement measures to protect personal information, including data encryption and anonymization.

#### Expected Outcomes

- **Enhanced Dataset**: A more comprehensive dataset capturing a wider range of collision incidents.
- **Improved Analysis**: Ability to analyze factors influencing both reported and unreported collisions, leading to more effective policy recommendations.
